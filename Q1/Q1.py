# All instructions, code comments, etc. contained within this notebook are part of the assignment instructions.
# Portions of this file will auto-graded in Gradescope using different sets of parameters / data to ensure that values are not
# hard-coded.
#
# Instructions:  Implement all methods in this file that have a return
# value of 'NotImplemented'. See the documentation within each method for specific details, including
# the expected return value
#
# Helper Functions:
# You are permitted to write additional helper functions/methods or use additional instance variables within
# the `Graph` class or `TMDbAPIUtils` class so long as the originally included methods work as required.
#
# Use:
# The `Graph` class  is used to represent and store the data for the TMDb co-actor network graph.  This class must
# also provide some basic analytics, i.e., number of nodes, edges, and nodes with the highest degree.
#
# The `TMDbAPIUtils` class is used to retrieve Actor/Movie data using themoviedb.org API.  We have provided a few necessary methods
# to test your code w/ the API, e.g.: get_movie_cast(), get_movie_credits_for_person().  You may add additional
# methods and instance variables as desired (see Helper Functions).
#
# The data that you retrieve from the TMDb API is used to build your graph using the Graph class.  After you build your graph using the
# TMDb API data, use the Graph class write_edges_file & write_nodes_file methods to produce the separate nodes and edges
# .csv files for submission to Gradescope.
#
# While building the co-actor graph, you will be required to write code to expand the graph by iterating
# through a portion of the graph nodes and finding similar artists using the TMDb API. We will not grade this code directly
# but will grade the resulting graph data in your nodes and edges .csv files.

# BUILDING YOUR GRAPH
#
# Working with the API:  See use of http.request: https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#examples
#
# Using TMDb's API, build a co-actor network for the actor's/actress' movies released in 1999.
# In this graph, each node represents an actor
# An edge between any two nodes indicates that the two actors/actresses acted in a movie together in 1999.
# i.e., they share a movie credit.
# e.g., An edge between Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Downey Jr. indicates that they have acted in one
# or more movies together in 1999.
#
# For this assignment, we are interested in a co-actor network of movies in 1999; specifically,
# we only want the first 5 co-actors in each movie credit with a release date in 1999.
# Build your co-actor graph on the actor 'Laurence Fishburne' w/ person_id 2975.
#
# You will need to add extra functions or code to accomplish this.  We will not directly call or explicitly grade your
# algorithm. We will instead measure the correctness of your output by evaluating the data in your nodes.csv and edges.csv files.
#
# GRAPH SIZE
# Since the TMDB API is a live database, the number of nodes / edges in the final graph will vary slightly depending on when
# you execute your graph building code. We take this into account by rebuilding the solution graph every few days and
# updating the auto-grader.  We compare your graph to our solution with a margin of +/- 200 for nodes and +/- 300 for edges.
# 
# e.g., if the current solution contains 507 nodes then the min/max range is 307-707.
# The same method is used to calculate the edges with the exception of using the aforementioned edge margin.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#

#   Find all of Laurence Fishburne's movie credits that have a release date in 1999.
#   FOR each movie credit:
#   |   get the movie cast members having an 'order' value between 0-4 (these are the co-actors)
#   |
#   |   FOR each movie cast member:
#   |   |   using graph.add_node(), add the movie cast member as a node (keep track of all new nodes added to the graph)
#   |   |   using graph.add_edge(), add an edge between the Laurence Fishburne (actor) node
#   |   |   and each new node (co-actor/co-actress)

#   ENDIF
#
#   FOR each node in nodes:
#   |  get the movie credits for the actor that have a release date in 1999.
#   |
#   |   FOR each movie credit:
#   |   |   try to get the 5 movie cast members having an 'order' value between 0-4
#   |   |
#   |   |   FOR each movie cast member:
#   |   |   |   IF the node doesn't already exist:
#   |   |   |   |    add the node to the graph (track all new nodes added to the graph)
#   |   |   |   ENDIF
#   |   |   |
#   |   |   |   IF the edge does not exist:
#   |   |   |   |   add an edge between the node (actor) and the new node (co-actor/co-actress)
#   |   |   |   ENDIF
#   |   |   END FOR
#   |   END FOR
#   END FOR
# END LOOP
#
# Your graph should not have any duplicate edges or nodes
# Write out your finished graph as a nodes file and an edges file using:
#   graph.write_edges_file()
#   graph.write_nodes_file()
#
# END BUILD CO-ACTOR NETWORK
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exception handling and best practices
# - You should use the param 'language=en-US' in all API calls to avoid encoding issues when writing data to file.
# - If the actor name has a comma char ',' it should be removed to prevent extra columns from being inserted into the .csv file
# - Some movie_credits do not return cast data. Handle this situation by skipping these instances.
# - While The TMDb API does not have a rate-limiting scheme in place, consider that making hundreds / thousands of calls
#   can occasionally result in timeout errors. If you continue to experience 'ConnectionRefusedError : [Errno 61] Connection refused',
#   - wait a while and then try again.  It may be necessary to insert periodic sleeps when you are building your graph.
